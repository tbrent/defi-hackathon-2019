 * @dev Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an account

 * To change ownership, use a 2-part nominate-accept pattern.
 *
 * This contract is loosely based off of https://git.io/JenNF but additionally requires new owners
 * to accept ownership before the transition occurs.
